Sir Daniel Wilson Residence
0
You are in front of the Sir Daniel Wilson Residence.
You wake up at the Sir Daniel Wilson residence in your dorm. You look at your phone to see that the time is 8AM. You remember that you have an exam today at 6PM, but you can't seem to find any of the things that you need for your exam, namely your TCard, lucky pen, a cheat sheet and a water bottle. You walk down to the basement passage.
