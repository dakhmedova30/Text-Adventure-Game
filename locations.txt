Sir Daniel Wilson Residence

You are in front of the Sir Daniel Wilson Residence.
You wake up to the sound of loud music playing from the room next to you. Groggily, you look at your phone to see that the time is 8AM. You remember that you have an exam today at 6PM, but you can't see some things that you need for the exam - your TCard, lucky pen, and cheat sheet are nowhere to be found. And curiously, so is your water bottle. You get up from your bed and head to the door next to yours from where the music is coming from and knock on the door.
